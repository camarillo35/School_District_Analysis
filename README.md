# School_District_Analysis
Purpose
    The purpose of this data analysis task was to return various metrics to the school board so they can compare passing rates with school types, budget dollars, and school size. The pass rate metrics were focused on reading and math. The initial analysis was completed with all fifteen schools, across the ninth through twelfth grade. The final report used modified data due to the discovery of academic dishonesty among the ninth-grade students at Thomas High School.

How is the district summary affected?
    After the removal of the entire Thomas High School ninth-grade class, results did not change the average or passing scores by a significant amount. The largest decrease was the percentage of students passing reading, which saw a 0.3% drop.
    
How is the school summary affected?
    The school summary saw insignificant changes to the passing rates in math and reading. The passing rate in reading increased by 0.2% and the passing rate in math increased by 0.1% after the removal of invalid data. 
    
How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
    Replacing the scores of the ninth-grade students still had Thomas High School second in the overall standing of passing rates.
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following?
•	Math and reading scores by grade replacing the ninth-grade scores with NaN didn’t change the data for any other grades. Had the data with zero values the data sets would have changed significantly and skewed all the numbers for the district.
•	The scores by school spending did not change at all since we still included the ninth-grade students in the analysis. This is because academic dishonesty does not disqualify the school from funding opportunities. 
•	The scores by school size did not change with the first analysis since the total amount of students is over thirty-thousand and only an estimate four-hundred students were removed. 

Summary
In the school size analysis, we can see that the percent passing math decreased by 0.02% and the percentage passing reading decreased by 0.06%. The combined passing rate decreased by 0.06% after removing the ninth-grade class. The analysis by school type only changes if we review the data to the third decimal place. In this instance, we can see that the average math score decreased by 0.009% and the average reading score decreased by 0.006%.
